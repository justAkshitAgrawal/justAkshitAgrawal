I'm a software engineer / full stack engineer who lives in India. I love creating beautiful websites and web apps. Currently, I'm interning at Harness.io as an SDE. My tech stack includes: Next.js, React, TypeScript / JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, Prisma and MongoDB. You can find all of my projects on my github, and feel free to contribute to any of them by simply opening a PR.

Here's my portfolio: [akshitagrawal.dev](https://akshitagrawal.dev);
